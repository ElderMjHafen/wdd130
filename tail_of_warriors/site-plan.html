        Main Questline: Main Questline: On another world a planet Manareth a world with anthropomorphic animals
        and nonanthropomorphic animals, there are three fractions, one called Monarchic Council who seeks to
        takeover Veariaum (Vear-e-a-um) and every providence around it through deceit, manipulation, beguiling
        specious and pinning species against each other or force if they cannot lie to grab power. Free Order
        sets to defend the providences from the conquest of the Monarchic Council and stop their deceptions
        having hold over them and confront the overarching entity as well as confront the Wildbringers.
        Wildbringers, an anti civilization organization who seeks bring down and collapse all the other
        fractions and civilization on Manareth into nonexistence and return all into ways of the wild,
        eliminating all concepts of civilization at all and force everyone into living as nonanthropomorphic
        animals, sending all into a world of survival of the fittest exactly as such in the wilds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wildbringers views are that cause of the hardships, conflicts and suffrage are cause by people
        living the wilds for civilization and seeks to bring it down and sends everything into the Ways of the
        Wilds and natural selections. So, that anthropomorphic animals would become just as the same
        nonanthropomorphic animals and their ultimate goal that over generations of forbidding civilization
        that the line between the animals would become nonextant. And they plan that this would integrate
        vicious repulsion against any glimpse against anything that would lead to return any form of
        civilization whatsoever, the Wildbringers are even against hut dwellings.

        Outworlders Questline: While on a journey traveling through the wilderness in the providence of
        Veariaum (Vear-e-a-um) one of the adventures, that was quest mentioned previously, had a random
        encounter with a bizarre automaton that does not look like any design of any civilization or nation
        this adventurer has ever seen. This is very curious to the adventure, so they escort or took it to
        an automaton expert, a raven named Huginn, who researches and design automatons to figure out this
        origins of machine and who designed it. This was a second time an automaton of unknown origin such
        as this one that was brought to him. Unbeknownst to the adventure that the automaton has a purpose
        to observe this land, their world, their planet, Manareth from another as anything its sees would
        be seen by those sent it, who are surprised that this planet is inhabited, by as one of their
        members referred to them, “medieval, middle age era furries” no less. The Outworlders, as the
        Manarethlings would soon referred to them, later would send colony and settlers to Manareth. The
        outcome of the inhabitants and Outworlds would vary based on choices of the adventurers, ranging
        from forming a treaty after battles or preventive, allowing them to have settlers and lands like
        the others around them, the Outworlders being subjects to one of the providence, Outworlders being
        completely friendly through negotiation or hostile, requiring strategy to defeat them.
