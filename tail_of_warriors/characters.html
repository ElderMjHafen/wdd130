                                    by the Wildbringers who had forced prior victims to live as ferals. Being a survivor
                                    he is sent out confront the Wildbringers througout the providences and made cavalier.
                                    He is able cover ground rather quickly and effectively being Taur, he doesn't need a
                                    mount, he is the mount, although he typically will not allow others to use him as one.

                                <p>Marl uses long swords and his legs when in combat. He has exellent hearing and reflexes
                                    making difficult and more dangerous for foes to attack him from behind.

                                    by the Razkazcan King as a equerry and as a equire. He was practically part of the
                                    royal family, until as he was stewarding for the royals, he stumpled upon a group
                                    conspiring a coup with Monarchic Council members from Veariaum against the royals
                                    to maintain the monarchy as the royals proposed to establish a cheif judge and
                                    judges as had Veariaum. Vaanhi tried to warn the royals about this conspiracy,
                                    but regardless of him try to go in cover to try to warn or he capture by the
                                    rebels, he failed and the kingdom fell under a new rule instead of having judges
                                    being establish. He fled from Razkazca to Veariaum and now become a young adventurer.
