                                having hold over them and confront the overarching entity as well as confront the Wildbringers.
                                Wildbringers, an anti civilization organization who seeks bring down and collapse all the other
                                fractions and civilization on Manareth into nonexistence and return all into ways of the wild,
                                eliminating all concepts of civilization at all and force everyone into living as nonanthropomorphic
                                animals, sending all into a world of survival of the fittest exactly as such in the wilds.

                                Wilds and natural selections. So, that anthropomorphic animals would become just as the same
                                nonanthropomorphic animals and their ultimate goal that over generations of forbidding civilization
                                that the line between the animals would become nonextant. And they plan that this would integrate
                                vicious repulsion against any glimpse against anything that would lead to return any form of
