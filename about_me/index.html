    <h2>Michael J. Hafen</h2>
    <p>My hobbies are drawing and playing video games on my free time.
        On Saturdays I play Dungeon and Dragon or Pathfinder a similar
        game. I'm taking coding classes to learn to program, using the
        skills needed to become indie game developer, at times I use my
        free time to work on making a game, the engine I'm using has
        some assist, but need to learn more coding to make mt own. Web
        design could help by making a website about it.

    <p> I am currently single, I was born into the church, so I have
        been a member all my life. My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7
        "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I
        will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
        for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the
        children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that
        they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."
